fountain~
   This is the most beautiful fountain you have ever set your eyes upon!  It
has a marble bottom, which is clean enough to eat off from.  In the center of
the fountain, you see some stone FIGURES.  They have their mouths open.  As you
look closely you can see that there is water streaming out from the mouths.  
What a neat idea!

   Below each statue is engraved a name.  Rumble and Ferret.  More is written
below the names but you must look more closely to read it.

rumble names ferret~
   To bring peace where there was only war.  To bring justice where there was
only inequity.  To bring freedom where there was only coercion.  To bring
balance where there was only chaos.  To bring Sanctum to the world.
