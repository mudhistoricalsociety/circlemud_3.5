   This Zone was created by Brett Lynnes and Andy McLeod We're just some bored
college students from Montana...  So you don't need to credit us for it.  
Besides, I sorta stole the idea off of a mud I played a while back.  
Smurfville is an anooying place with lots of do-gooder smurfs and (of course)
Gargamel's castle.  ** added bonus- Barney's playland I made the entrance on
