Door Example~
2 c 100
move~
* Example by Falstar for room 14520
* The following trigger is designed to reveal a trapdoor leading down when 
* Player types 'Move Chest'
*
* The following ARGument determines what can be MOVEd ('move' Command inserted
* in Arg List of trigger)
if %arg% == chest
  *Send text to player to show effect of command
  %send% %actor% You move the chest across the floor, revealing a trapdoor underneath!!
  *Send text to other players in room to inform them of Player's discovery
  %echoaround% %actor.name% %actor.name% has discovered a hidden trapdoor under a chest!
  * Set door flags to 'ab' - Exit is a door that can be opened and closed, then close door
  %door% 14520 down flags ab
  * Change door name to 'trapdoor' (used in door commands, eg open trapdoor, lock trapdoor)
  %door% 14520 down name trapdoor
  * Set room that trapdoor exits leads to (Room 14521 in this case)
  %door% 14520 down room 14521
  * Set Exit desc for the wary adventure who decides to 'look down'
  %door% 14520 down description A wooden ladder leads down into the darkness.
  * Set the Vnum of the KEY OBJECT which will lock/unlock door
  %door% 14520 down key 14500
  * Now for Continuity, door commands must be set for reverse direction FROM 14521
  %door% 14521 up flags ab
  %door% 14521 up name trapdoor
  %door% 14521 up room 14520
  %door% 14521 up description A wooden ladder leads up into a storeroom.
  %door% 14521 up key 14500
  * IMPORTANT: Note reverse of direction in both the commands and extra 
  * descriptions and room numbers it can be very easy to get lost here and 
  * probably get your adventurer lost too. Finally set up what happens when 
  * adventurer tries to move anything else and end the trigger
else
  %send% %actor% Move what ?!
end
* Another example by Welcor
* if %arg% == tapestries
*   %send% %actor% You pull the tapestries down, and reveal a secret vault!
*   %echoaround% %actor% As %actor.name% pulls the tapestries down a secret vault is revealed.
*   %door% 23667 east flags abcd
*   %door% 23667 east key 23634
*   %door% 23667 east name vault
*   %door% 23667 east room 23668

IF Example~
0 g 100
~
* By Relsqui
* First we set %anumber% to some number between 1 and 100.
eval anumber %random.100%
* Then the beginning of the if-block.
if (%anumber% == 5)
  * The following commands are only executed if the above condition is true.
  * (That is, if %anumber% is equal to 5.)
  clap
  say It's your lucky day!
  say You picked my favorite number!
  * If those commands were executed, the program skips to the next end.
  * Otherwise, it looks for an elseif.
elseif (%anumber% > 90)
  * To read the following commands, the program must have determined the 
  * following: The first condition (%anumber% == 5) is false.
  * The second condition (%anumber% > 90) is true.
  emote shrinks down to the size of a mouse.
  say Squeak squeak squeak!
  * If the first elseif condition was also false, the program looks for the 
  * next one.
elseif (%anumber% < 10)
  * Here's a tricky one.
  * If %anumber% equals 5, the program will already have run the commands 
  * immediately after the if-statement at the top. Therefore, the following 
  * commands only run when: %anumber% is not five (failing the first check.)
  * %anumber% is not greater than 90 (failing the second check.)
  * %anumber% is less than 10 (passing the third check.)
  emote grows an elephant's nose.
  emote blows a mighty blast with %self.hisher% trunk.
  * And now, the default, when %anumber% fails all the above checks.
else
  * Note that else has no condition.
  emote disappears in a cloud of blue smoke.
  %purge% %self%
  * For that to happen, all of this must be true: %anumber% is not five. 
  * %anumber% is not greater than 90. %anumber% is not less than 10. If all 
  * those conditions are met, the mob will disappear in a cloud of blue smoke.
  * Finally, please don't forget the all-important...
end
* Ends are good. They tell the program when the if-block is over. After any of 
* the above sets of commands runs, the program skips to the next end. 
*
* Notes:
* We could have omitted the else. If we had, and none of the conditions had 
* been met, no commands in the if-block would run. However, there can never be 
* more than one else. There is only one default. There must always be the same
* number of if's and end's. We could have had any number of ifelses, from zero 
* on up. To summarize, here is the basic format of an if-block:
* if (condition)
*   (commands)
* elseif (condition) <---optional. 0 or more
*   (commands)
* else <---optional. 1 or 0
*   (commands)
* end
*
* So the simplest possible if-block would be:
* if (condition)
*   (commands)
* end
