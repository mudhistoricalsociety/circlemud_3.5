A Wide Dirt Path~
   This path is trampled, hundreds of people must have marched along this
trail.  The dirt is packed solid and is several yards in width.  It almost
looks like an army was marched through here.  A lake shrouded in fog is to 
the west and the city wall is to the east

note~

if they knew the truth they would all leave him and Camelot would be
defenceless.  The threat comes from a time portal to the northwest where the
dead have returned and seek to gain possesion of camelot.  Very few know the
truth.....  The note suddenly dissolves in your hands.

Merlins Tower~
   You notice a large pulsating pentagram in the northern part of the room
which throbs and humms in time to your heartbeat.  There is also a SIGN 
here with unearthly glowing red lettering which blinks over and over the 
message LOOK AT ME Your inner coice, which has always served you well 
so far, screams at you to LEAVE IT ALONE!

sign~
   You look at the sign.  At first you can't understand it, but then the
lettering adjusts to a language you understand.  It says: BEWARE OF 
DEMON!  I have imprisoned a FOUL, NASTY, EXTREMELY POWERFUL demon in this
pentagram.  To those inside, there are NO EXITS.  Even Lancelot would 
certainly die in the pentagram.  THERE IS NOTHING OF WORTH IN THE 
PENTAGRAM, ONLY DEATH, and nothing short of DIRECT DIVINE INTERVENTION 
will get you out of it.  - Merlin

Northeast Tower~
   Across the lake you see the city of Bellau Woods.  It looks so peaceful 
from here and you wonder how these guards can stand up here for hours on 
end without falling asleep.  A guard whispers something to one of the 
lookouts, you catch a couple words, something about putting you to work in 
the army.

Bedroom~
   This small room is overcrowded with a small decrepit looking bed, a 
small desk and various bookshelfs that teeter from the weight of countless
books.  The room looks more like a study than a bedroom.  The desk is 
covered with papers and notes that someone hastily scribbled down.  Most 
of it is illegible, but one note stands out.

Battle Field~
   You see the zombies leave to the north towards a massive tower that 
rises above the foothills.  Bodies lie everywhere right up to the base 
of the tower, there must be over a thousand dead.
