The Jade Forest~
   You find yourself standing at the entrance of a thick forest.  Numerous
trees tower over you, making you feel quite small.  In the distance you can
hear birds chirping.

The Jade Forest~
   The shadows of the trees seem to engulf you.  The light in here is extremely
scarce, allowing you to see very little.  Tall blades of grass cover your legs,
making you feel like you're walking through a swamp.

   As you continue making your way through the forest, you see several colorful
plants hiding in the grass.  You begin to wonder if anyone ever cuts the grass
in here.  Someone could get lost!

   You seemed to have stepped into a large patch of weeds.  They loom over you,
making you feel lost.  Perhaps you will be safer here in the weeds.  But then
again, maybe not.

The Jade Forest~
   Weeds begin to wrap around your feet, threatening to pull you down onto the
ground.  You struggle to get free, pulling weeds from the ground and throwing
them aside.  You decide it would be a good idea to walk a little faster.

garden.

A Dirt Path~
   The path comes to an end here, leaving you in a field of tall grass.  The
grass comes up to your chin, making it very difficult to see anything around
you.  Trees tower over you, making you feel like a lost child.
