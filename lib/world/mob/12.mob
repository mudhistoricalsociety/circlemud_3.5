the wandering spirit~
A strange amorphous being wanders these halls eternally cleaning.
~
   This spirit, having lived out its days in the mortal world, now works off its
final sins by doing menial labour in this realm's purgatory.  In this case,
those chores seem to be cleaning up after the immortals of the land.

Santa's mob~
Santa, this mob is not appropate on a PG mud.
~
   Santa, I changed this mob because the world's slut, porn star and other such
themes/words are not appropate for this mud.  If you have a problem with this
you may speak to Rumble, but as he is not here right now the desision lays upon
me.  If you wish to know who altered it, my name is Shamra and I am a level 33,
please do not make mobs/objects/rooms/triggers like this again.
