A Long Hallway~
   The hall stretches north and south.  Lanterns set in brackets along the wall
offer ample lighting.  The smokeless kerosene that is used leaves a strange
smell.  The Hall is bare, only a few small paintings cover the walls.  Clerics
have very little need for decorations of any kind.  A small waiting room is to
the west.

Clerics Avenue~
   The cobblestone road is in decent shape, though a few stones have been
overturned leaving gaping holes.  No wagons travel down this part of the city.
Everyone knows Clerics have no need anything besides what they can provide by
themselves.

Magi.  As people often say, cleanliness is next to godliness.

They dedicate their lives to helping others, never themselves.  Every one of
them would sacrifice their lives for that principle.

   Within the Cleric's Quarter an adventurer has very little to worry about.  
Even those would be vandals, pickpockets, and thugs shy away from this Quarter
because of their respect of the clerics.  To be a cleric is second only to
being a Master Magi.

maybe three times your own height.  You can just make out a small walkway on

is not privileged enough to be told about.  Rumours abound, especially about

The Tower of the Magi~
   Everything is made from black stone.  At first it looks to be marble, but
upon closer examination you can't see any grain within it.  Looking into the
stone you seem to lose yourself.  Peering further and further into the
blackness, you cannot tell whether it is a trick of the eye or some strange
magic at work here.  The center of the Magi's Quarter lies to the east.

The Magis Quarter~
   You stand within the heart of the Magi's Quarter.  To the east you may enter
the Magi's Mansion where the Master Magi can be found when they are not
guarding the Orb.  To the west the pure black Tower of the Magi houses the
sacred Orb that protects the city.

The Magi Mansion~
   The walls are adorned in fancy draperies and expensive tapestries of every
style and design imagineable.  The Magi believe in a life of service to their
discipline, but they also believe that they should be able to live in comfort.
This building is one of the most elaborate within the entire city.

A Study~
   Books line the walls, low hanging lantersn are positioned over three large
tables around the room. Several chairs per table allow those who wish to study
the fine art of magic to rest comfortably. Several books lay open upon the
tables. A trickle of smoke seeps around the edges of a door to the east.

The Healer's Shop~
   Small indoor gardens have been set up within this small house to grow the
herbs and mix the salves required to support the duties of the Cleric.  They
are rumoured to sometimes sell some of their remedies, though this is very rare
and at a very steep price.

form of antiseptic stings your nose and eyes.  All the beds are empty, must be

north and west.

A Large Basin~
   A large basin of water lies against the southern wall.  Small statues
surround the edge.  A small portrayal of woman and children playing on a rivers
edge.  This water must be the sacred water used by the Cleric's to tned the
wounded.

   The smell of medicine fills the entire tower.  A large open area, the center
of the tower, to the north holds a set of stairs leading higher into the tower.
Small benches line the walls here, allowing people to rest from their
adentures.

A Waiting Room~
   Benches line both walls here.  Several injured people hold cuts or bruises
that need to be tended by the healers.  An apprentice does what he can to aid
the people with bandages and water, but these people need the attention of a
real healer.

   To the east the Tower of the High Council of Clerics glows a bright white,
it's polished surfaces reflecting all light down onto the Cleric's Quarter it
protects.  To the west the Tower of the Magi does the exact opposite, seeming
to absorb all light surround it.  Their must be balance in all things.

The smell of dust and musty old papers emanates from them.  Many centuries of
knowledge lie within these books that were salvaged from the lands beyond.  
Many more have yet to be foun

A Tower Hallway~
   Through a small door to the north you can see the center of the tower where
a set of spiral staircases lead to the second floor.  The Orb of Sanctum is
protected somewhere within this tower.  The Master Magi have been given the
task of ensuring it's safety.

The Magi's Hallway~
   The seven Orders of the Magi are slowly dying out.  That is why they rarely
fight in battles any longer.  They have instead devoted their time to training
future Magi to take their places.  But, good students have become even harder
to come by these days.

A Magi Training Room~
   Short tables with cushions surrounding them are placed about the room.  
These cushions are obviously meant to kneel on and the tables are overflowing
with various books.  This must be some sort of study room for the Magi.  The
black walls seem to absorb the white light coming from strange bulbs hanging
from the ceiling.

   The smell of old paper that is slowly crumbling to dust fills the room.  
Thousands of books, scroll, parchments, and even some tablets fill the
bookshelves, tables and the floor of this under sized room.  It is here a vast
amount of the Magi have left thei findings when delving into the depths of
their magic.

The Southern Gate~
   The heavily fortified passage between the gate and the wilderness beyond is
well protected against an attack.  Lookouts can be heard above chatting idly
while the sentinel guards stand at attention waiting to be called into action.

The Stables~
   The smell of hay and manure clings to the room like a cheap cologne your
grandmother used to wear.  Stalls line both sides of the cramped building with
bales of hay stacked everywhere the horses can't reach though they all seem to
still try.  It is possible to buy a horse for a minimal fee, but not all of
them are well tamed and have been known to become ornery.

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   To make a pet shop you need two rooms and some pets. The rooms MUST be
sequential. If the first room is 3015 then the second must be 3016. The second
room is known as the storeroom. All that is required in the storeroom is to
load one of each mob you wish to be a pet. This room can not have any exits and
will never be used by mortals. Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is
recommended. In order to implement a pet shop the actual mud code has to be
modified. Just ask Rumble to do it for you.

On the Window Ledge~
   From this perilous perch you have an excellent view of the southern half of
the city.  A gust of wind howls past trying to pull you with it.  The only exit
is back into the tower or a deadly jump to the cobblestone road below.

The Lab~
   The room is covered in shadow and what little that can be seen is a clutter
of books, scrolls, and potions. The entire room is scarred from fire and a fine
ash covers everything. Smoke still lingers in the rafters overhead.

The Realm Of The Dead~
   You are standing on an immense, grey stone floor that stretches as far
as you can see in all directions.  Rough winds plunging from the dark,
starless sky tear savagely at your fragile body.

   The stone floor is the same shade of grey as the sky and is completely plain
