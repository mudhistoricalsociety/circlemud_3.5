Getting To Know Your "lib" Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

etc/	Files maintained by the game which you should not touch while
	the game is running.

house/	Crash-save files for player houses.

misc/	Miscellaneous database files such as fight messages, invalid names,
	and socials.

plralias/ All of your player's aliases are stored here in the same
	three letter encoding scheme as the plrobjs/ directory.

plrfiles/ ASCII player files.

plrobjs/  The hierarchy containing player object files (i.e. crash files,
	rent files, cryo-rent files, etc.).

plrvars/  Trigger variables.

text/	Files meant to be directly read by players such as MOTD (message of
	the day), help files, and the immortal handbook.  You can change
	these files while the game is running, and then have the mud re-read
	them using the 'reboot' command.

	triggers, and zones).
