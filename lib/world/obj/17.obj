E
sword excalibur~
   You run your fingers over the blue green steel of excalibur, and you feel a
tingling sensation.  Your vision blurs until all you see is a blinding white
light.  A warm sensation fills your limbs, and a sense of relaxed comfort
permeates you.  A deep fatherlike voice says "Now that Arthur is dead, it is up
to you to right what he wrought.  Seek out and destroy Mordred and Morgan Le
Fey.  They are destroying Camelot." The voice and the light gradually fades
leaving you with only a lingering warm feeling.
